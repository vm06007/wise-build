    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p><b>WISE Token</b>, hereinafter referred to as <b>WISE</b>, is an
        ERC-20 compliant smart contract designed for deployment on the
        Ethereum blockchain. WISE is a decentralized,
        <ss name="liquidity transformer epoch">fairly launched</ss>,
        <ss name="uniswap provision">automatically liquid</ss>,
        <ss name="token exchanges">trustlessly exchangeable</ss>,
        <ss name="staking">interest-bearing</ss>,
        <ss name="wise token purpose">bond-like</ss> token.</p>

    <p>This document is a general technical specification of the contract and
        its functionality.</p>

    <p>Mainnet launch of the WISE contract is scheduled for
        <span className="nowrap">October 8, 2020</span></p>
</section><section>
    <h2>WISE Token Purpose</h2>

    <p>The core purpose of the WISE token &mdash;
        <ss name="staking">staking</ss> &mdash; is similar to both
        bonds and CDs (certificates of deposit): rewarding the holder with
        earned interest in exchange for locking up their funds for a period of
        time. WISE incorporates some of the features from both of these
        traditional instruments but improves greatly upon them.</p>

    <p><a>CDs</a> tend to be lower risk, lower return, and only pay out interest
        on their maturity date.</p>

    <p><a>Bonds</a> tend to be somewhat higher
        risk, higher return, and pay out interest regularly on a set schedule
        (typically every six months).</p>

    <p><a>WISE</a> is most similar to a bond, in that it earns relatively high
        interest, but allows users to withdraw it whenever they want.</p>

    <strong><a>WISE is superior to bonds and CDs in every way:</a></strong>

    <p>WISE gives the staker complete flexibility in choosing exactly when to
        <ss name="scraping stake interest">withdraw their interest</ss>
        during the life of the stake. You can withdraw interest daily,
        irregularly, wait until maturity, or whatever you like!</p>

    <p>WISE stakes have higher return, much lower risk (due to being
        decentralized and trustless), and far higher flexibility than both bonds
        and CDs. No more trusting banks and governments to stay solvent and not change
        their rules. No more worrying that a bond issuer may default on you.</p>

    <p>WISE is pure, immutable code.</p>
</section><section>
    <h2>The Wise Foundation</h2>

    <p>The Wise Foundation is an unincorporated nonprofit association formed in
        February 2020. The WISE contract and various
        <ss name="official web interface">related software and websites</ss> are
        being wholly funded and developed by The Wise Foundation.</p>

    <p>The Wise Foundation is dedicated to providing material through which
        anyone may understand the contract in depth. This is an important step
        towards fostering a high level of trust in the contract source code and
        its functionality, as not everyone has the means or will to digest the
        code.</p>

    <p>The WISE contract source code will be made public on
        <a href="https://github.com/wise-foundation">our Github</a> at
        launch. <ss name="source code audit">A paid, professional audit of the
        WISE contract source code has been completed and included
        in this document</ss>.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, or would like to discuss the project with
        the founders, developers, and the rest of the community, please join the
        <a href="https://t.me/WiseToken">official WISE Telegram group at
        https://t.me/WiseToken</a>. We welcome all interested, respectful
        parties to our humble community. For various news releases related to

    <h2>Motivations and Principles</h2>

    <p>Trusting your money in the custody of other humans is inherently risky.
        This glaring flaw in traditional financial instruments is a primary
        motivation for developing WISE. The WISE contract aims to ensure that
        a user can always be in full custody and control of their WISE tokens,
        even during the course of various economic activities.</p>

    <p>The <ss name="minting tokens">initial minting of WISE</ss>, earning
        <ss name="reservation referrals">referral bonuses</ss>,
        <ss name="opening stakes">opening</ss> and <ss>closing stakes</ss>,
        <ss name="closing stakes">receiving interest</ss>, and even
        <ss name="token exchanges">selling WISE for ETH or other tokens</ss>
        can all be done end-to-end without the user's WISE tokens ever being
        under the control of another person or system. Compare this to the world
        of banks you can('t) trust and traditional money managers that (don't)
        have your best interests at heart.</p>

    <p>One very important aspect of owning cryptocurrencies is having a place to
        safely, easily, and quickly trade them when the need arises. We believe
        Uniswap, a popular and highly regarded decentralized exchange (DEX)
        smart contract on Ethereum, is such a place. Following the fifty day
        <ss>Liquidity Transformer Epoch</ss>, the WISE contract will
        automatically, trustlessly, and irrevocably
        <ss name="uniswap provision">bootstrap its own initial liquidity pool
        on Uniswap</ss>. At least 90% of all ETH sent by users to the WISE
        contract during the LT Epoch will in turn be automatically transferred
        to Uniswap by the WISE contract, along with an amount of minted WISE in
        equal value.</p>

    <p>In exchange for and simultaneous to this liquidity pool deposit, Uniswap
        transfers to the WISE contract an appropriate amount of UNI liquidity
        tokens, which carry the sole power to later withdraw that liquidity
        pool. The WISE contract will automatically, immediately, and provably
        destroy these UNI tokens by transferring them to a known burn address.
        In doing so, the WISE contract ensures that this initial ETH/WISE
        liquidity pool cannot be withdrawn from Uniswap by any person, party,
        contract, or entity &mdash; for all eternity.</p>

    <p>The WISE contract also allows users to earn interest on WISE token time
        deposits called <ss name="staking">stakes</ss>, which are most similar
        to bonds, but more flexible. A stake earns interest like a bond, but
        with the added feature of allowing interest withdrawals at any time
        during the life of the stake; not something bonds allow. These bond-like
        interest-bearing stakes in WISE are always fully in the custody of the
        user and their wallet, never held, influenced, or able to be confiscated
        by any third party.</p>
</section><section>
    <h1>WISE Contract Functionality</h1>

    <p>The WISE contract has several key properties and core functions,
        outlined in detail in the following sections. Some of the important
        mathematical calculations and data structures are also presented here.
        Various example scenarios of user and multi-user activity and contract
        state evolution are illustrated where appropriate.</p>
</section><section>
    <h2>General Properties</h2>

    <p>The contract defines the token name as <code>"Wise Token"</code>, the
        token symbol as <code>"WISE"</code>, and the number of decimals as
        <code>18</code>.</p>

    <p>The base unit of WISE is called <code>YODA</code>. One WISE is composed
        of one quintillion (1 &times 10<sup>18</sup>) YODA.</p>

    <p>Time is tracked by the contract in whole day increments, beginning at Day
        <code>0</code>, which starts at the midnight UTC preceding the contract
        deployment. The individual days used for the
        <ss name="liquidity transformer epoch">LT Epoch</ss> will be higher day
        numbers in the code, rather than literally being day numbers
        1&ndash;50.</p>

    <p>The contract has no special functionality granted to the deploying
        account, no administrative keys, and no concept of a contract owner. All
        users, including the founders and developers, have precisely equal
        access to the contract's functionality.</p>

    <p>The contract, once deployed, is immutable. No proxy or delegate contracts
        are involved.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Token Supply</h3>

    <p>The contract has no set token supply. The total initial supply minted by
        users through the
        <ss name="Liquidity Transformer Epoch">Liquidity Transformer</ss> will
        fall within a defined range, determined partially by confined
        randomness, and partially by
        <ss name="reservation referrals">referral bonuses</ss>.</p>

    <p>The 50 day Liquidity Transformer has an average of five million WISE
        available each day, though some days have randomness involved.
        This means the total supply available in the LT will likely be around 250
        million WISE. Due to referrer bonuses, there could be up to an
        additional 10% minted on top of that (i.e. up to 25 million more).</p>

    <p>This total supply is then matched by a minted batch that is then
        <ss name="uniswap provision">sent permanently to Uniswap</ss>. The amount
        of WISE sent to Uniswap will be up to 10% less than what was mintable
        through the LT and referral bonuses, due to the foundation reimbursement
        ETH. Regardless, the ratio of WISE/ETH sent to Uniswap will match
        exactly the ratio of mintable LT WISE (including referral bonus WISE) to
        LT ETH. This ensures that the initial Uniswap price matches the overall
        price of the LT.</p>

    <p>The total supply of WISE in existence after the LT and Uniswap provision is
        subject to LT randomness, referral activity, and whether the foundation
        reimbursement ends up being a full 10% or less due to the hardcoded cap.</p>

    <p>For example, if we assume the randomness averages out, assume half of
        all possible referrer bonuses are earned, and assume the foundation
        reimbursement cap causes it to be only 5% of the LT ETH, then the total
        initial supply would be:</p>

    <pre><code>
        baseLTSupply = 250,000,000 WISE<br/>
        referrerBonuses = baseLTSupply * 5% = 12,500,000 WISE<br/>
        totalLTSupply = baseLTSupply + referrerBonuses = 262,500,000 WISE<br/>
        uniswapBatch = totalLTSupply * 95% = 249,375,000 WISE<br/>
        <br/>
        totalInitialSupply = totalLTSupply + uniswapBatch = 511,875,000 WISE
    </code></pre>

    <p>Though extremely unlikely (virtually impossible), the absolute minimum
        possible total initial supply (all random days get their minimum values,
        no referral bonuses, and a low enough LT ETH total that makes the
        foundation reimbursement exactly 10%) would be:</p>

    <pre><code>
        baseLTSupply = 180,000,010 WISE<br/>
        referrerBonuses = baseLTSupply * 0% = 0 WISE<br/>
        totalLTSupply = baseLTSupply + referrerBonuses = 180,000,010 WISE<br/>
        uniswapBatch = totalLTSupply * 90% = 162,000,009 WISE<br/>
        <br/>
        totalInitialSupply = totalLTSupply + uniswapBatch = 342,000,019 WISE
    </code></pre>

    <p>Though equally unlikely (virtually impossible), the absolute maximum
        possible total initial supply (all random days get their maximum values,
        maximum referral bonuses, and a high LT ETH total that makes the
        foundation reimbursement approach 0%) would be:</p>

    <pre><code>
        baseLTSupply = 319,999,990 WISE<br/>
        referrerBonuses = baseLTSupply * 10% = 31,999,999 WISE<br/>
        totalLTSupply = baseLTSupply + referrerBonuses = 351,999,989 WISE<br/>
        uniswapBatch = totalLTSupply * ~100% = 351,999,989 WISE<br/>
        <br/>
        totalInitialSupply = totalLTSupply + uniswapBatch = 703,999,978 WISE
    </code></pre>

    <p>The total token supply will <ss name="supply inflation">inflate at a
        rate of 4% per year</ss>, starting once the Liquidity Transformer
        Epoch ends and the <ss>Circulation Epoch</ss> begins. Some of the new
        tokens will be minted directly to stakers upon
        <ss name="closing stakes">closing a stake</ss>, and some minted to
        <ss name="stake referrals">stake referrers</ss>. If no stakes are closed
        on a given day, and no stakes scrape interest on that day, no new tokens
        are actually minted that day, though they are earmarked to be minted
        later. Once a stake is closed, all tokens the stake had earmarked to it
        for all past days are then minted at once.</p>
</section><section>
    <h2>Liquidity Transformer Epoch</h2>

    <p>The launch of the WISE contract will kick off an initial 50 day phase
        during which users may send ETH (or any ERC-20 token traded on Uniswap V2) to the contract in
        order to reserve WISE tokens. The tokens reserved can be
        <ss name="minting tokens">minted by the users</ss> immediately following
        the end of the LT Epoch, i.e. the start of day 51.</p>

    <p>Each day of the LT Epoch will have an amount of WISE tokens that are
        reservable by all those who deposit ETH to that day. Most days will
        have exactly five million WISE available, but the other days will have
        their available WISE amount randomly set within a predefined range.
        These random amounts will be determined by the contract shortly after
        the end of each random day, by leveraging the
        <a href="https://provable.xyz/">Provable</a> (formerly called
        “Oraclize”) smart contract's Random Datasource interface. The generated
        randomness is delivered on-chain in a trustless and provably
        cryptographically secure manner. For more detailed information about
        Provable, please read their
        <a href="https://provable.xyz/papers/random_datasource-rev1.pdf">random
        datasource white paper</a> and their
        <a href="https://docs.provable.xyz/#security-deep-dive">security deep
        dive</a>.</p>

    <p>Each day's available WISE ends up getting split amongst the users who
        deposited ETH to that day, in direct proportion. In other words, a
        user that made a reservation on a particular LT day will later be able
        to mint the fraction of that day's available WISE that equals the
        fraction of the day's total ETH they personally sent in.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Token Reservation</h3>

    <p>On any given day of the LT Epoch, users may choose to send ETH (or any
        ERC-20 token traded on Uniswap V2) to the contract and assign it to any of the LT Epoch days
        that have not yet concluded. We call this action a “token reservation”.</p>

    <p>For example, during day 12, users may send and assign ETH to any of the
        days 12&ndash;50, but not to days 1&ndash;11, since those days have already
        concluded.</p>

    <p>Each token reservation is assigned to a single day, but users may make as
        many such reservations as they wish, to as many different days as they
        wish.</p>

    <p>The WISE contract front end will also include the ability for a user to
        spread a single reservation amount of ETH (or ERC-20) evenly across all
        remaining LT days. This &ldquo;dollar cost averaging&rdquo; feature
        saves gas for the user who wishes to reserve an equal part of each LT
        day.</p>

    <p>Reservations can be made with ETH, but also with any ERC-20 token that's
        traded on Uniswap V2. This
        is done via direct integration with Uniswap, which swaps the ERC-20
        for ETH as part of the reservation transaction. This is functionally
        the same as the users themselves swapping the ERC-20 for ETH on Uniswap,
        and then later sending the ETH to the WISE contract for a token
        reservation. The benefit of using the WISE reservation interface to do
        this is that it saves the user some gas fees and time.</p>

    <p>Each single token reservation must be of a minimum ETH amount, to make
        spam attacks cost-prohibitive. The specific minimum amount will be
        finalized at a later date, closer to launch. This is because the price
        of ETH may change significantly between the time of this writing and
        the contract launch. The minimum will likely be in the neighborhood of
        $10 worth of ETH.</p>

    <p>The contract will provide public interfaces for viewing the total amount
        of ETH currently assigned to each LT Epoch day across all users, as
        well as the total WISE available for each day (where that supply has
        been determined, in the case of random days). For days where the supply
        has not yet been finalized, the min/max range will also be retrievable
        from the contract.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Daily LT Supply Schedule</h3>

    <p>Every LT day has an average of five million WISE available for
        reservation. Some of the days with randomly determined amounts have
        tight ranges only a few hundred thousand WISE in variance, and others
        are extremely variant, ranging from a single WISE to ten million WISE
        (technically 9,999,999 WISE, in order to preserve a strict average
        of five million per day). In this way, the LT Epoch provides various
        exciting options for users wishing to gamble with their ETH, and at
        various levels of risk/reward.</p>

    <p>The following table outlines how many WISE will be available for user
        reservation on each day of the LT Epoch. Most days have exactly five
        million WISE available. The rest show two supply values: the minimum and
        maximum available that day. Each day is color coded for relative risk
        level, from <span class="no-risk">none</span> to
        <span class="high-risk">high</span>):</p>

    <h3>Reservation Referrals</h3>

    <p>The WISE contract has a direct, one-level referral system that rewards
        both the referrer and referee when a user reserves WISE tokens in the
        LT. This referral system is an incentive to help increase the amount of
        ETH sent in, in turn funding a larger and more robust initial
        liquidity pool on Uniswap.</p>

    <p>When a user makes a <ss>token reservation</ss>, the front-end interface
        checks if their browser has a referral cookie stored. If such a cookie
        is present, the contract makes note of the referrer's ethereum address
        and associates it with the referee's token reservation. The contract
        also tags the user's token reservation as having been through a
        referral, and this reservation is credited as having been 10% more
        ETH than it actually was. When the user <ss name="minting tokens">mints
        their reserved tokens</ss> after the end of the LT Epoch, each token
        reservation that was through a referral will thus mint 10% more WISE
        than if it hadn't been through a referral.</p>

    <p>Users may change the referral cookie stored in their browser at any time
        by clicking another referrer's link. If they do, their future token
        reservations would be associated with the new referrer. All past token
        reservations for that user remain as is; their previous referrer(s) do
        not lose credit for their existing referred token reservations.</p>
</section><section>
    <h4>Referrer Bonuses</h4>

    <p>When the LT Epoch ends, referrers that have referred enough ETH into
        the system, via their referred users' token reservations, can then mint
        an amount of bonus WISE.</p>

    <p>The LT referrer bonus system has two tiers. Bonuses (paid in WISE) are
        based on how much total ETH their referral link brought in to the
        LT:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><i>Refer 1 - 49.999999999999999999 ETH</i>
            <br><strong>Bonus = 0.05 ETH (paid in WISE)</strong></li>

        <li><i>Refer 50 or more ETH</i>
            <br><strong>Bonus = 10% of ETH (paid in WISE), and
            <ss name="stake referrals">“CM Referrer”</ss> status</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alice refers a few friends who, in total, send 0.83
            ETH into the LT. Alice fails to reach the 1 eth minimum for
            the first tier, so she earns no bonus WISE.</li>

        <li>Bob refers several friends who, in total, send 3.6 ETH into the
            LT. Bob qualifies for the first bonus tier, so he earns a flat
            bonus of 0.05 ETH worth of WISE.</li>

        <li>Eve creates several WISE videos and publishes her referral link on
            them. Users clicking her referral link send a total
            of 64 ETH in to the LT. Eve qualifies for the top bonus
            tier, so she earns 6.4 ETH worth of WISE, as well as permanent
            <ss name="stake referrals">“CM Referrer”</ss> status.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Note: all referral bonuses are paid in WISE. When the LT ends,
        an effective total LT WISE/ETH exchange rate is calculated by looking
        at the total amount of ETH sent in by all users, and the total amount
        of WISE made available for reservation. This ratio is then used to
        calculate the amount of WISE for each referral bonus.</i></p>
</section><section>
    <h2>Circulation Epoch</h2>

    <p>When the final LT Epoch day ends, the Circulation Epoch begins. At this
        point, no further token reservations can be made.</p>

    <p><ss name="token reservation">Reserved WISE</ss> and
        <ss name="referrer bonuses">referrer bonus WISE</ss> may now be minted
        by users, at their leisure. Users may begin <ss name="staking">staking
        WISE</ss>. 90% or more of all ETH sent into the LT and a matching
        batch of WISE is automatically <ss name="uniswap provision">sent to
        Uniswap</ss>, so users may begin trading WISE and ETH there. All
        <ss name="erc-20 functionality">standard ERC-20 functions</ss> involving
        minted tokens are also now available. At the start of the fifteenth day
        of the Circulation Epoch, there will be a one-time automatic
        <ss name="shares and interest">share price</ss> increase of 10%.</p>

    <p>Once the LT Epoch has ended, there is a public function in the contract
        that may be called by anyone to trigger the following one-time sequence
        of actions to start the Circulation Epoch:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Calculate the total ETH sent into the LT. Set aside 10% or 2,000 ETH,
            whichever is less, for the
            <ss>Wise Foundation reimbursement</ss> performed in Step 4 below.
            The remaining 90% (or more) of this ETH is the <strong>“Uniswap
            Provision Ether”</strong>.</li>

        <li>Calculate the total WISE that is available to be minted due to token
            reservations and referrer bonuses. Calculate the same
            fraction of this WISE (90% or more) that was used to determine the
            Uniswap Provision Ether in Step 1 above. Immediately mint this
            amount of new WISE. This is the <strong>“Uniswap Provision
            WISE”</strong>.</li>

        <li>Transfer the “Uniswap Provision Ether” and “Uniswap Provision WISE”
            to the WISE/ETH Uniswap exchange pair contract, forming its
            initial liquidity pool. As part of this transfer, the WISE contract
            receives back from the Uniswap contract an amount of UNI-V2
            liquidity tokens and immediately burns these by transferring them
            to a known burn address.</li>

        <li>Transfer the 10% (or less) of LT ETH set aside in Step 1 to The
            Wise Foundation's ethereum address.</li>
    </ol>
</section><section>
    <h3>Uniswap Provision</h3>

    <p>The WISE contract's constructor function, executed when deploying the
        WISE contract, will make a call to the Uniswap V2 factory contract in
        order to create the Uniswap WISE/ETH exchange pair contract. This
        newly created exchange contract's address will be stored internally
        in the WISE contract.</p>

    <p>This newly created Uniswap WISE/ETH exchange pair contract will simply
        lie dormant until the Circulation Epoch begins and the Uniswap provision
        transfer is executed, using the stored address. No minted WISE exists
        until that point, so no liquidity can be added until then.</p>

    <p>As part of sending the Uniswap provision WISE and ETH to the exchange
        pair contract, a UniswapV2Router contract is used, which internally
        wraps the ETH into WETH (wrapped ETH), as is standard in Uniswap
        V2.</p>

    <p>The UniswapV2Router contract returns an amount of UNI-V2 liquidity tokens
        to the WISE contract as part of the Uniswap provision transaction. These
        UNI-V2 liquidity tokens represent ownership of the liquidity pool the
        WISE contract just sent in, and carry the sole power to withdraw that
        liquidity. The WISE contract has no code or function allowing such
        a liquidity withdrawal. However, as a further show of The Wise
        Foundation's commitment to making WISE a totally trustless system, the
        WISE contract will automatically and irrevocably destroy these UNI-V2
        liquidity tokens upon receipt. This is done by transferring them to a
        known “burn address”, such as
        <code>0x0</code>.</p>

    <p>Once the Uniswap provision is complete, users are free to use Uniswap's
        front end to swap WISE into ETH, and vice-versa. They may also choose
        to deposit their own liquidity pools of WISE/ETH in order to earn
        fees from traders.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Wise Foundation Reimbursement</h3>

    <p>Prior to deploying the WISE contract, The Wise Foundation will determine
        its total expenses incurred in developing and launching WISE. These will
        include wages paid to developers, fees paid to lawyers, marketing spend,
        and the cost of the audit.</p>

    <p>This expense total is represented in the contract source code
        as a hardcoded amount of 2,000 ETH.</p>

    <p>When the LT Epoch closes and the
        Circulation Epoch begins, the total ETH sent into the LT gets
        divided into two buckets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>10% of the LT ETH (not to exceed 2,000 ETH)</li>
        <li>All remaining LT ETH</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The 10% (or less) bucket of ETH is then transferred to an ethereum
        address owned by The Wise Foundation. The other bucket (90%+) is sent
        to Uniswap to create the first liquidity pool for WISE.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Minting Tokens</h3>

    <p>Once the LT Epoch has ended and the Circulation Epoch has begun, users
        may now mint WISE tokens, either due to having
        <ss name="token reservation">reserved WISE in the LT Epoch</ss> or
        having <ss name="referrer bonuses">earned referral bonus WISE</ss>, or
        both.</p>

    <p>The minting of WISE is done on-demand by the user, in a single batch,
        through the front-end interface. The interface will show how many WISE
        the user can mint, broken down by reservation and/or referral bonus
        sources. Users may mint their WISE immediately, or wait as long as they
        like, without penalty.</p>

    <p>Users will likely want to mint their WISE sooner rather than later
        in order to take advantage of <ss>staking</ss> them to earn interest,
        which becomes less profitable the longer one waits.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Supply Inflation</h3>

    <p>The total circulating supply of WISE inflates at a constant rate of 4%
        per year. At the end of every day of the Circulation Epoch, the contract
        calculates how many new WISE will need to be minted for that day in
        order to achieve that rate of inflation.</p>

    <pre><code>
        totalWiseSupply = circulatingWise + stakedWise<br/>
        dailyInflationRate = (1.04 ^ (1 / 365) - 1)<br/>
        dailyInflationRate =~ 0.0001074597820279<br/>
        <br/>
        newWiseToday = totalWiseSupply &times; dailyInflationRate
    </code></pre>

    <p>These new daily inflation WISE are not immediately minted. Instead, they
        are earmarked for distribution to two parties: three quarters (3% inflation) to all
        active <ss name="shares and interest">stake shares</ss> on that day, and
        one quarter (1% inflation) to all active, qualified
        <ss name="stake referrals">CM shares</ss> that day. Each active stake is
        earmarked a fraction of this new WISE in proportion to the stake's
        shares' percentage of the total share pool that day. The same
        apportionment scheme is used for the WISE earmarked to qualified CM
        shares.</p>

    <p>An example scenario:</p>

    <pre><code>
        On day X, suppose there are:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;100,000,000 total circulating WISE<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;30,000,000 total staked WISE<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;10,000,000 total shares<br/>
        <br/>
        The total new WISE that will be generated this day is then:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;newWiseDayX = (100,000,000 + 30,000,000) &times;
        0.0001074597820279<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;newWiseDayX = 13,969.771663627 WISE<br/>
        <br/>
        This new WISE is split into two amounts:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;three quarters for stake shares (i.e. 3% inflation)<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;one quarter for CM shares (i.e. 1% inflation)<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, suppose user A has an active stake that is 2,000,000 shares.<br/>
        On day X, this user's stake then gets some WISE earmarked for it:<br/>
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;userANewWiseDayX = newWiseDayX &times; (3/4) &times; stakeShares /
        totalShares<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;userANewWiseDayX = 13,969.771663627 &times; (3/4) &times; 2,000,000 /
        10,000,000<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;userANewWiseDayX = 2,095.46574954405 WISE<br/>
    </code></pre>
</section><section>
    <h3>Staking</h3>

    <p>The WISE contract allows users to stake their WISE, locking it up for a
        period of days, in order to earn interest. This is the primary function
        of the contract during the <ss>Circulation Epoch</ss>.</p>

    <p>Users may open as many stakes as they like. After a stake reaches full
        maturity, the user may close it at any time to receive their full
        principal, plus interest, without penalty.</p>

    <p>Unlike some other stakeable tokens, WISE never penalizes a mature stake,
        no matter how late it is eventually closed. This allows users much more
        flexibility, especially for taxable income purposes. Also, should a user
        pass away before being able to close their stakes in a timely fashion,
        the WISE contract thus remains in compliance with estate laws of various
        jurisdictions that make it illegal to penalize the assets of a deceased
        person.</p>
</section><section>
    <h4>Opening Stakes</h4>

    <p>When a user opens a new stake, they choose an amount of WISE to stake,
        and a stake length in days. The minimum stake amount is 0.000000000001
        WISE (1000000 YODA). The minimum stake length is one day, and the
        maximum stake length is 15,330 days (just under 42 years).</p>

    <p>Once a stake is opened, it is in “Pending” status. This means
        that the stake won't technically begin until the following day. A user
        may close a stake in Pending status, receiving back the stake's
        principal, without penalty or interest.</p>

    <p>Pending stakes become “Active” status once the next day begins. At this
        point, closing the stake before it reaches “Mature” status will incur a
        penalty.</p>

    <p>When a stake is opened, the WISE tokens staked are actually burned by the
        contract and converted into
        <ss name="shares and interest">“shares”</ss>.  These shares exist for
        the life of the stake. Once the stake is closed, the shares are
        destroyed, and WISE is minted back to the user (along with any interest
        added and penalties deducted.</p>
</section><section>
    <h4>Shares and Interest</h4>

    <p>When a stake is opened, its WISE principal is burned and converted into shares.
        These shares represent the stake size and length as well as, indirectly, how early
        the stake was opened. The amount of shares a newly opened stake gets is
        determined by a global “share price” tracked in the WISE contract, as
        well as a percentage bonus based on the length of the stake.  This share
        price only increases, hence staking earlier is better than later.</p>

    <p>Stakes earn interest daily through the WISE supply inflation, as well as
        from other <ss name="closing stakes">stakes' penalties</ss> paid. The
        <ss name="supply inflation">WISE supply inflates</ss> at about 4%
        per year. Three quarters of that inflation (i.e. 3% APR) is distributed
        daily to all active stakes, in proportion to their shares as compared to
        the total share pool. The remaining one quarter (i.e. 1% APR)
        is distributed daily to the
        <ss name="stake referrals">CM referrer shares</ss> in the same
        proportional manner.</p>

    <p>Depending on the length of the stake, a bonus amount of shares will be
        generated on top of the amount determined by the staked amount of WISE
        and current share price. This bonus scales linearly from slightly above
        0% for a one day stake, to 25% for a 5 year stake, and then to 30% for a
        42 year stake. For instance, a stake with a length of 1.5 years will
        generate<code>1.5 * 5% = 7.5%</code> bonus shares.</p>

    <p>The share price starts at some predetermined value denominated in
        <code>WISE per share</code>. Whenever any stake is closed, the contract
        calculates a ratio of that stake's total return (principal + interest -
        penalty) to its shares. If this ratio is greater than the current share
        price, then the share price is immediately set to this new, increased
        value.</p>

    <p>The share price can only increase over time, albeit fairly slowly. This
        ensures that earlier stakes get more shares than later stakes of the
        same amount of WISE. This share price increase mechanism also prevents
        users from being able to compound their interest with a sequence of
        smaller stakes in order to try and outperform a single long stake of the
        same size.</p>

    <p>On the start of the fifteenth day of the <ss>Circulation Epoch</ss>, the
        share price will be automatically increased by 10% as a one-time event.
        This creates a very strong incentive for users to open their stakes during
        the first two weeks of the Circulation Epoch. Waiting until day
        fifteen to open a stake will mean you get roughly 9% less shares than you
        would have on the previous day, for the same amount of WISE staked. In
        turn, that means roughly 9% less interest earned by the stake.</p>
</section><section>
    <h4>Scraping Stake Interest</h4>

    <p>Users will have the ability to withdraw (scrape) any amount of earned
        interest from an Active stake (i.e. before the stake fully matures).</p>

    <p>Users can choose exactly how much interest they wish to scrape, up to
        the maximum (all accrued, unscraped interest from all previous days).
        Scraping interest from an Active stake can be done multiple times over
        the course of the stake.</p>

    <p>Scraping interest is possible starting on day 2 of the active stake. On
        day 1 (the first active day), the stake has not yet completed a full
        day of being active, and thus has not yet accrued any interest.</p>

    <p>When a stake is closed, whether Active or Mature, the interest minted
        back to the user only includes interest that hasn't already been
        scraped.</p>

    <p>Scraping interest will not affect the stake's principal, but will reduce
        the number of shares the stake has going forward. This effectively means
        that the stake will earn slightly less interest on the current and all
        future days of the stake than it otherwise would have. This share
        reduction also prevents users from being able to end up with more
        overall shares if they choose to immediately re-stake their scraped
        interest.</p>

    <p>Scraping interest may cause a
        <ss name="shares and interest">share price</ss> increase, just as when
        <ss name="Closing Stakes">closing a stake</ss>. Stakes track exactly how
        much cumulative scraped interest the user has scraped over the course
        of the stake, for the purpose of these calculations. The process for
        determining the possible share price increase and the stake shares
        reduction is as follows:</p>

    <p>First, calculate a possible new share price based on the stake's
        pseudo-return (principal plus all scraped interest thus far, including this scrape)
        divided by the stake's initial shares:</p>

    <pre><code>
        newSharePrice = (stakePrincipal + cumulativeScrapedInterest) / stakeInitialShares
    </code></pre>

    <p>Next, if this new share price is greater than the current global share
        price, update the global share price (which may have just increased due
        to this scrape):</p>

    <pre><code>
        if (newSharePrice > globalSharePrice) globalSharePrice = newSharePrice
    </code></pre>

    <p>Next, calculate an amount of shares to be removed from the stake,
        based on the interest being scraped now and the global share price:</p>

    <pre><code>
        stakeSharesToRemove = interestBeingScrapedNow / globalSharePrice
    </code></pre>

    <p>Finally, reduce the stake's current shares:</p>

    <pre><code>
        stakeCurrentShares = stakeCurrentShares - stakeSharesToRemove
    </code></pre>
</section><section>
    <h4>Closing Stakes</h4>

    <p>A user may close a stake at any time. Depending on the stake's status
        (where the stake is in its lifecycle), different things will
        happen:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Closing a <a>Pending</a> stake - the stake shares are destroyed. The
            entire stake principal is minted back to the user, without interest
            or penalty.</li>

        <li>Closing an <a>Active</a> (premature) stake - the stake shares are
            destroyed. The stake principal is penalized (see below) and minted
            back to the user along with all interest accumulated thus far.</li>

        <li>Closing a <a>Mature</a> stake - the stake shares are destroyed. The
            entire stake principal and all interest accumulated is minted back
            to the user. There are never any penalties for closing a Mature
            stake, no matter how late.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The penalty deducted from the principal (stakedWise) when closing an
        Active stake is as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>
        If the stake is one day long:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;penaltyAmount = stakedWise &times; 0.1<br/>
        <br/>
        If the stake is two or more days long:<br/>
        &nbsp&nbsp;penaltyAmount = stakedWise &times; (.1 + .8 &times;
        ((daysLeft - 1) / (stakedDays - 1)))
    </code></pre>

    <p>Thus, if you close an Active stake that was 100 days long on its final
        day before maturity, you get a 10% penalty applied to the principal. If
        you close the same stake on the first day of it being Active, you get a
        90% penalty. The penalty scales linearly between those two extremes.</p>

    <p>Any such WISE penalized from a stake's return is earmarked for
        distribution to all active stake shares that day. These penalty
        distributions are only realized by those stakes' shares when each of
        those stakes end.</p>
</section><section>
    <h4>Stake Referrals</h4>

    <p>Just as the WISE contract includes a referral program to incentivize
        users to help bring more ETH into the
        <ss name="liquidity transformer epoch">Liquidity Transformer</ss>, it
        also provides a referral program for staking.</p>

    <p>When a user opens a new stake, the front-end interface checks whether the
        browser has a referral cookie, just as it does when making a <ss>token
        reservation</ss> in the LT Epoch. If such a cookie is present, AND the
        new stake is at least 365 days long, the contract tags this new stake
        with the referrer's address.</p>

    <p>A referred stake generates 10% extra shares for the staker (beyond what
        it would have if not referred) as well an equal (but without the 10%
        bonus) amount of “critical mass shares” (a.k.a. “CM shares”) for the
        referrer. The system-wide pool of CM shares gets earmarked one quarter
        of the daily inflation WISE, but only for referrers that have qualified
        as CM referrers.</p>

    <p>To qualify as a CM referrer, a user must have reached a
        total of $10,000 worth of referred stakes of 365+ days
        in length. If a user meets this condition, they are immediately and
        forever tagged as a CM referrer, and cannot ever lose that distinction,
        regardless of if their referees close all their stakes.</p>

    <p>Another way to qualify as a CM referrer is to have referred 50 ETH of
        token reservations in the <ss name="referrer bonuses">referral system
        of the LT Epoch</ss>. Users reaching that level are automatically
        pre-qualified as CM referrers forever.</p>

    <p>Calculating a new stake's USD value is only done once, when the stake is
        opened. The WISE/USD exchange rate used for this calculation will be
        determined by querying the Uniswap WISE/ETH and ETH/DAI exchange
        pair contracts' price oracle interfaces.</p>
</section><section>
    <h3>Liquidity Provider Staking</h3>

    <p>WISE has an additional way of staking that rewards liquidity providers
        for the WISE/ETH pair if certain conditions are met. If the liquidity
        percentage of WISE on Uniswap falls below 20%, then you may stake your
        LP tokens with the WISE contract and start earning interest (on top of
        the trading fees you already get).</p>

    <p>This new money comes from the 3% inflation for stakers such that, the 3%
        for stakers slowly decreases and the 0% for LPs slowly increases. Once
        this triggers, it will become valuable for a certain amount of people to
        LP stake since there is now a new pot of money available for LPs to earn
        daily interest.</p>

    <p>An additional perk for LP staking is that you may end
        your stake at any time and collect your LP tokens. When the Uniswap
        liquidity goes back above 30%, the rewards slowly start diminishing. The
        staking inflation will creep back up towards 3% and the LP inflation
        will creep back towards 0% until triggered again.</p>

    <p>This is a safeguard in the system that will most likely not be triggered
        for years if at all. Users can still choose to add to liquidity
        themselves at any time in order to earn about 6% ROI from fees, but the
        additional incentive of shares interest doesn't trigger until
        needed.</p>
</section><section>
    <h2>ERC-20 Functionality</h2>

    <p>The WISE contract conforms fully with the ERC-20 token standard, as
        proposed in
        <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md">EIP-20</a>.
        This is essentially a set of functions that a token contract must implement
        in order to be an ERC-20 token.</p>

    <p>This ERC-20 standard compliance means that applications, websites,
        exchanges, and smart contracts can very easily integrate with or be
        built on top of the WISE contract.</p>

    <h1>WISE Website</h1>

    <h2>Referral Links</h2>

    <p class="aside">ATTENTION: the WISE referral link and cookie system is
        <strong>ALREADY LIVE!</strong> You can start spreading your ref link today and
        building a base of referred users well before contract launch. So, do
        yourself a favor and start spreading your ref link everywhere!</p>

    <p>Format:
        <code class="select-all">https://wisetoken.net/?w=YOURETHADDRESS</code></p>

    <p>Example: <a href="https://wisetoken.net/?w=0x91143a01a6111ac86efBcc92Fc4f86c01c10AE9F">
        Get 10% Bonus WISE!
    </a>

    <p>Anyone may use a referral link to direct users to the WISE website, this
        Teal Paper, the forthcoming official contract web interface, or any
        other page on the <a href="https://wisetoken.net/">wisetoken.net</a>
        domain or its subdomains, in order to potentially earn various referral
        bonus WISE from those users' contract interactions.</p>

    <p>When a user clicks such a ref link, the wisetoken.net website stores a
        cookie on their browser, containing the referrer's eth address from the
        ref link. If that user later sends ETH to the LT or starts a stake at
        least one year in duration, the cookie will cause the contract to mark
        that LT reservation or stake as having been referred by that
        referrer.</p>

    <p>If a user already has a referral cookie in their browser and clicks a
        different ref link, the cookie will be overwritten with the second
        ref link's ethereum address. Referrals are thus "last click wins".</p>

    <p>Referral links containing invalid ethereum addresses will not work; the
        website will not create (or overwrite) the cookie.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><a>WISE</a> &mdash; the token and contract described herein.</li>
        <li><a>YODA</a> &mdash; the base unit of the WISE token, analogous to
            wei for ETH, or satoshi for BTC. One WISE equals one
            quintillion YODA (1,000,000,000,000,000,000).</li>
        <li><ss name="staking">Stake</ss> &mdash; a time locked deposit of WISE
            which earns interest over time.</li>
        <li><ss>Liquidity Transformer Epoch</ss> &mdash; the first fifty days of
            the contract's existence, during which users may deposit ETH to
            reserve part of the initial supply of WISE.</li>
        <li><ss>Circulation Epoch</ss> &mdash; the epoch immediately following the
            end of the LT Epoch, during which users may mint their tokens
            reserved in the LT Epoch, transfer tokens, stake tokens, etc.</li>
        <li><ss name="token exchanges">Uniswap</ss> &mdash; a decentralized,
            non-custodial ERC-20 token and ETH exchange on the Ethereum
            blockchain. The WISE contract is integrated directly with Uniswap.
            General info on Uniswap is <a href="https://uniswap.org/">here</a>,
            Uniswap exchange stats are
            <a href="https://uniswap.info/">here</a>, and the main
            exchange is <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/">here</a>.
            </li>
        <li><a>ERC-20</a> &mdash; a standard interface for Ethereum smart
            contract tokens. ERC stands for “Ethereum Request for Comment”. The
            original EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) describing ERC-20
            tokens can be found

    <h2>Coding Standards</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The WISE contract is written entirely in Solidity and compiled with
            solc 0.7.2.</li>

        <li>The code should adhere to the formats prescribed by the
            <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.2/style-guide.html">style
                guide</a> section of in the official
            <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.2/">Solidity 0.7.2
                documentation</a>.</li>

        <li>All public interfaces (at a minimum) should be annotated using the
            <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.2/natspec-format.html">NatSpec
                format</a>.</li>

        <li>Unit tests should provide 100% coverage of the source code. All
            conceivable edge and corner cases should be covered.</li>

        <li>Function and variable names should convey their purpose and usage as
            clearly and tersely as possible, in plain English. Avoid using
            digits, unnecessary abbreviations, acronyms, shorthand, or
            slang.</li>

        <li>Functions should be as short as is practical. They should do what
            their name implies, and not much else. A good rule of thumb is that
            a function should try to be viewable in its entirety on a typical
            monitor, at a typical font size, if at all possible.</li>

        <li>Comments should be employed wisely. Don't comment to explain what
            code does. Good function and variable names will accomplish that.
            Rather, use comments to explain why something is coded a certain
            way, Use comments to explain any non-obvious technical points or
            decisions involved in a piece of code.</li>

        <li><code>require()</code> function calls should return a short but
            descriptive error message, always prefixed with "WISE: ".</li>

        <li>Avoid duplicated code (don't repeat yourself).</li>

        <li>Wherever possible and practical, write with gas efficiency as a
            priority. Some parts of the code may sacrifice minuscule gas
            efficiencies for various important reasons. When deemed to be of
            greater value, code legibility, clean architecture, and a
            straightforward and <ss name="end user contract interfaces">fully
            featured end-user experience</ss> should take priority over such
            tiny gas savings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Source Code Audit</h2>

    <p>The Wise Foundation has obtained a paid, professional audit of the WISE contract
        Solidity source code from <a href="https://www.coinfabrik.com/">CoinFabrik</a>, a
        reputable auditing firm. The full audit report is included below.</p>

    <p>TL;DR - The auditors' conclusion was, &ldquo;<i>We found that although the project shows a certain
        complexity, the code [is] well written and security has been taken into account.
        The documentation provided was also very helpful and relates correctly to what is
        implemented in the contracts. No security issues were found and the only
        non-security issue was quickly fixed by the team.</i>&rdquo;</p>
